    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets</li><br>
      <li>CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displyed on screen,paper, or in other media</li><br>
      <li><b style="text-decoration: line-through;">Css is not neccesary</b><b style="background-color: #e4e429ef;">CSS saves a lot of work.</b> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br>
      <li style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li><br>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>
        <li>Internal - by using style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a link elements to link to an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files . However, <span style="background-color: #e4e429ef;"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles</b></span>, because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for ou try it yourself </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements elements.ID,on the other hand, applies a style to on unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        In CSS, selectors are used to target a specifies element or range of elements on a web page.Once an elements has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.

    <p>
        There is a wide range of selectors avaliable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.s
